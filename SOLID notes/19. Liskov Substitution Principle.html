<h4>Liskov Substitution Principle</h4>

<p>The Liskov Substitution Principle is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming (<a href="http://springframework.guru/single-responsibility-principle/" rel="nofollow" title="Single Responsibility Principle">Single responsibility</a>, <a href="http://springframework.guru/open-closed-principle/" rel="nofollow">Open-closed</a>, Liskov Substitution, <a href="http://springframework.guru/interface-segregation-principle/" rel="nofollow">Interface Segregation</a> and Dependency Inversion). We have already written about the <a href="http://springframework.guru/single-responsibility-principle/" rel="nofollow" title="Single Responsibility Principle">single responsibility principle</a>, and these five principles combined are used to make object-oriented code more readable, maintainable and easier to upgrade and modify.<br></p>

<p>Liskov Substitution Principle states the following: <em>“in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.)”</em>. Simply said, any object of some class in an object-oriented program can be replaced by an object of a child class. In order to understand this principle better, we’ll make a small digression to briefly remind ourselves about the concept of inheritance and its properties, as well as subtyping, a form of polymorphism.</p>











<h4>Inheritance, Polymorphism, Subtyping</h4>











<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is a concept fairly simple to understand – it is when an object or a class are based on another object or class. When a class is “inherited” from another class, it means that the inherited class (also called subclass, or child class) contains all the characteristics of the superclass (parent class), but can also contain new properties. Let’s illustrate this with a common example: if you have a class Watch , you can inherit from that class to get a class PocketWatch . A pocket watch is still a watch, it just has some additional features.</p>











<p>Another example would be a class called Woman with a child class called Mother. A mother is still a woman, with the addition of having a child. This brings us to the next term we should explain, which is called <a href="http://springframework.guru/polymorphism-java/" rel="nofollow" title="Polymorphism in Java"><strong>polymorphism</strong></a>: objects can behave in one way in a certain situation, and in another way in some other situation. In object-oriented programming, this is called<em> context-dependent behavior</em>. To use the last example: a mother, when taking a walk with her child or attending a school parent’s meeting, will behave as a mother. But when she is out with her friends, at work or simply doing errands, she will behave as a woman. (As you can see, this difference is not that strict.)<br></p>











<p><strong>Subtyping</strong> is a concept that is not identical to <a href="http://springframework.guru/polymorphism-java/" rel="nofollow" title="Polymorphism in Java">polymorphism</a>. However, the two are so tightly connected and fused together in common languages like C++, Java and C#, that the difference between them is practically non-existent. We will still give a formal definition of subtyping, though, for the sake of completeness, but the details will not be discussed in this article. <em>“In programming language theory, subtyping (also subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism) is a form of type polymorphism in which a subtype is a datatype that is related to another datatype (the supertype) by some notion of substitutability, meaning that program elements, typically subroutines or functions, written to operate on elements of the supertype can also operate on elements of the subtype. If S is a subtype of T, the subtyping relation is often written S &lt;: T, to mean that any term of type S can be safely used in a context where a term of type T is expected.”</em></p>











<p>This brings us to the original theme of the article – the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>











<h4>Liskov Substitution Principle Examples</h4>











<p>The Liskov substitution principle, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Barbara Liskov">Barbara Liskov</a> in 1988, states that functions that reference base classes must be able to use objects of derived (child) classes without knowing it. It’s important for a programmer to notice that, unlike some other <a href="http://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gang of Four Design Patterns">Gang of Four</a> principles, whose breaking might result in bad, but <em>working code</em>, the violation of this principle will most likely lead to buggy or difficult to maintain code.<br></p>











<p>Let’s illustrate this in Java:<br></p>











<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class TrasportationDevice
{
   String name;
   String getName() { ... }
   void setName(String n) { ... }
   double speed;
   double getSpeed() { ... }
   void setSpeed(double d) { ... }
   
   Engine engine;
   Engine getEngine() { ... }
   void setEngine(Engine e) { ... }
   void startEngine() { ... }
}
</pre>





















<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Car extends TransportationDevice
{
   @Override
   void startEngine() { ... }
}</pre>





















<p>There is no problem here, right? A car is definitely a transportation device, and here we can see that it overrides the startEngine()  method of its superclass. </p>





<p>
Let’s add another transportation device:</p>





<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Bicycle extends TransportationDevice
{
   @Override
   void startEngine() /*problem!*/
}</pre>











<p>Everything isn’t going as planned now! Yes, a bicycle <strong>is</strong> <strong>a</strong> transportation device, however, it does not have an engine and hence, the method startEngine cannot be implemented.</p>







<p>These are the kinds of problems that violation of Liskov Substitution Principle leads to, and they can most usually be recognized by a method that does nothing, or even can’t be implemented.</p>







<p>The solution to these problems is a correct <strong>inheritance hierarchy</strong>, and in our case we would solve the problem by differentiating classes of transportation devices with and without engines. Even though a bicycle <strong>is a</strong> transportation device, it doesn’t have an engine. In this example our definition of transportation device is wrong. It should not have an engine.</p>







<p>We can refactor our TransportationDevice  class as follows:</p>







<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class TrasportationDevice
{
   String name;
   String getName() { ... }
   void setName(String n) { ... }

   double speed;
   double getSpeed() { ... }
   void setSpeed(double d) { ... }
}</pre>













<p>Now we can extend TransportationDevice  for non-motorized devices.<br></p>







<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class DevicesWithoutEngines extends TransportationDevice
{  
   void startMoving() { ... }
}</pre>













<p>And extend TransportationDevice  for motorized devices. Here is is more appropriate to add theEngine  object.</p>







<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class DevicesWithEngines extends TransportationDevice
{  
   Engine engine;
   Engine getEngine() { ... }
   void setEngine(Engine e) { ... }

   void startEngine() { ... }
}</pre>













<p>Thus our Car  class becomes more specialized, while adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>





<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Car extends DevicesWithEngines
{
   @Override
   void startEngine() { ... }
}</pre>













<p>And our Bicycle  class is also in compliance with the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>





<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Bicycle extends DevicesWithoutEngines
{
   @Override
   void startMoving() { ... }
}</pre>











<h4>Conclusion</h4>







<p>Object Oriented languages such as Java are very powerful and offer you as a developer a tremendous amount of flexibility. You can misuse or abuse any language. In the <a href="http://springframework.guru/polymorphism-java/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Polymorphism in Java">Polymorphism</a> post I explained the ‘Is-A’ test. If you’re writing objects which extend classes, but fails the <strong>‘Is-A’</strong> test, you’re likely violating the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>
